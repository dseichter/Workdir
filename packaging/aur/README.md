# AUR Package (Arch Linux)

## Overview

The `PKGBUILD` in this directory defines the Arch Linux User Repository (AUR) package for Workdir (`workdir-bin`).

## Package variants

- `workdir` (source): builds from source and uses Arch/Python system dependencies.
- `workdir-bin` (binary): installs prebuilt release binaries and is recommended for faster installs and minimal build dependencies.

### Version strategy

The `pkgver` field is **automatically derived from the git tag** by the CI workflow.  
Tag format: `v2026-03-10` → `pkgver=2026.03.10` (dashes replaced by dots, `v` prefix stripped).  
The reverse conversion (`${pkgver//./-}`) reconstructs the original tag for the source URL.

You never need to manually update the version in `PKGBUILD`.

## One-time setup

### 1. Create an AUR account

Sign up at <https://aur.archlinux.org>.

### 2. Add an SSH key

Generate a key (if you don't have one) and add the **public key** to your AUR account under  
_My Account → SSH Public Key_.

### 3. Register the package on AUR

The first time, clone the (empty) AUR repo for your package name:

```bash
git clone ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/workdir-bin.git aur-workdir-bin
cp packaging/aur/PKGBUILD aur-workdir-bin/
cd aur-workdir-bin
git switch -c master
# Generate .SRCINFO (required by AUR)
makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO
git add PKGBUILD .SRCINFO
git commit -m "Initial release"
git push -u origin master
```

### 4. Configure GitHub Actions secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository (_Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions_):

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `AUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | The private SSH key paired with the public key on AUR |

The AUR commit author name and email are regular workflow inputs with defaults. Adjust them in `.github/workflows/aur.yml` and `.github/workflows/aur-source.yml` if needed.

---

## Automation

After the one-time setup, the GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/aur.yml` handles everything automatically when you push a tag:

1. Computes the new `pkgver` from the tag.
2. Downloads the prebuilt Linux binary release asset and computes its `sha256sum`.
3. Patches `PKGBUILD` with the new version and checksum.
4. Pushes the updated `PKGBUILD` + `.SRCINFO` to AUR.

The local filenames in `source=()` are intentionally versioned. This prevents `makepkg` from reusing a stale cached file from an older release under the same local name, which would otherwise trigger a checksum mismatch.

For packaging-only fixes without a new upstream tag, rerun the AUR workflow manually with the existing `release_tag` and a higher `pkgrel` such as `2`.

## Manual release (without CI)

```bash
cd packaging/aur

# Update version and checksum manually
PKGVER="2026.03.10"
PKGREL="1"
sed -i "s/^pkgver=.*/pkgver=$PKGVER/" PKGBUILD
sed -i "s/^pkgrel=.*/pkgrel=$PKGREL/" PKGBUILD
SHA256=$(curl -fsSL "https://github.com/dseichter/Workdir/releases/download/v${PKGVER//./-}/workdir-archlinux-x86_64-v${PKGVER//./-}" | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1)
sed -i "s/^sha256sums=.*/sha256sums=('$SHA256' 'SKIP' 'SKIP')/" PKGBUILD

# Test the build locally (requires an Arch Linux machine or container)
makepkg -si

# If you previously built another release locally, clear old cached sources once
rm -f workdir-v* io.github.dseichter.workdir-v*.desktop io.github.dseichter.workdir-v*.png

# For a packaging-only hotfix of an existing upstream release, bump pkgrel
# Example: v2026-03-21 with the same binary but corrected packaging => PKGREL="2"

# Push to AUR
makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO
# Then copy PKGBUILD + .SRCINFO to your local AUR clone and push
```
