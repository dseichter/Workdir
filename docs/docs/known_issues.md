# Known Issues

## Window size on first run

If you run Workdir the first time, the window can be very small.

The size is automatically adjusted based on your configured directories, so after adding directories the layout will adapt.

## Notes

This behavior depends on platform-specific Qt rendering and available content in the main view.
